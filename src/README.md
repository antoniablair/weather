## Weather API App

This is a simple React / Redux application that fetches the weather forecast from a city.

It's in the beginning phases of a project, so would still need to have several things added to be a more
full-fledged webapp: 

- Form validation on the city submission form
- Javascript type checking (such as Flow)
- Unit tests to test for basic logic, such as parsing forecasts
- Error handling / display message to the user if the API is not successful
- If you look at a city's forecast and then begin typing in a different city, erase the forecast message

Ideally, I would also break out some of the styles into more reusable components.
